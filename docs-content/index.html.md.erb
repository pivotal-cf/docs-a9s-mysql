This documentation describes the a9s MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile. a9s MySQL for PCF
enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based, dedicated MySQL servers. Developers can
create instances of a MySQL server using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line
interface (cf CLI) and bind these instances to an app.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

When you run the cf CLI ```create-service a9s-mysql101``` command,
PCF creates dedicated VMs for this service instance. This allows
the best possible bad neighborhood protection.

MySQL service instance provisioning, including VM orchestration, is entirely automated.
This enables service instances to be highly isolated and shielded by infrastructure virtualization
mechanisms.

Due to the on-demand provisioning on VMs, only existing service
instances allocate infrastructure resources. These resources are released when service
instances are destroyed. Using on-demand provisioning the number of
service instances is not limited by design.

### <a></a>Current Features

The current version of a9s MySQL for PCF includes the following key features:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **On­-Demand Service Instance Provisioning** | a9s MySQL for PCF deploys MySQL instances automatically. Developers can provision a single-VM MySQL server using a single command. |
| **Service Instance Isolation** | Each MySQL server runs on a dedicated VM to ensure bad neighborhood protection in order to be aligned with enterprise security requirements.<br/><br/>a9s MySQL for PCF uses Cloud Foundry security groups to prevent network connections being established by unauthorized apps.
| **Smoke Tests** | a9s MySQL for PCF contains a post-deploy smoke tests errand that runs a series of basic test against your installation to ensure that it is configured properly. |
| **Service Instance Capacity Upgrade** | Cloud Foundry Service Plan updates allow upgrades to the RAM, CPU, and storage capacity for your MySQL instances. |
| **Logging and Monitoring** | Each MySQL service instance provides log messages and MySQL-specific metrics to one or more `syslog/graphite` endpoints. You can configure the `syslog/graphite` endpoint to receive logging and monitoring information. |
| **Deployment Updater** | This errand automatically updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s MySQL for PCF service instances to their lastest version. |
| **Service Guard** | The Service Guard creates Cloud Foundry security groups for your service instance VMs.<br /><br /> When the IP address of a service instance changes, the guard updates the security group. The Service Guard also restarts the application instances bound to the affected service instance. **The instances of one app are restarted one by one to avoid downtime.**|
| **High Availability** | a9s MySQL for PCF ensures high-availability.<br/><br/>The Consul-based internal DNS system provided by a9s Consul DNS for PCF ensures that the connected application always connects to a working node. |
