This topic describes how to install and configure a9s MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).


##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before installing a9s MySQL for PCF,
ensure that you have installed and configured the products and tiles listed in [Requirements](./index.html#reqs).

This comprises of the **a9s Consul DNS for PCF** tile and the **a9s BOSH for PCF** tile.

The a9s Consul DNS for PCF tile is required because it is responsible
for providing an internal DNS system to the other a9s service tiles, the a9s
MySQL for PCF included.
For more information about this tile,
see [The Purpose of the a9s Consul DNS for PCF Tile](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/a9s-consul-dns/usecase.html).

The a9s BOSH for PCF tile is required because it is used by the a9s
service tiles, for the provisioning and lifecycle management of their VM.
For more information about this tile, see [a9s BOSH for PCF Use Case](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/a9s-bosh/usecase.html).


##<a id='install'></a> Install and Configure a9s MySQL for PCF

To install a9s MySQL for PCF, perform the following steps:

1. Download the product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/a9s-mysql).

2. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product**
to upload the product file.

3. Click **Add** or **+** (depending on the PCF version) next to the uploaded a9s MySQL for PCF tile in the Ops Manager
**Available Products** view to add it to your staging area.

4. Click the newly added tile, and then click **Settings** to review the configuration settings.
  See the following sections for more information on how to configure the properties in each settings pane:
  * [Assign AZs and Networks](#azs)
  * [Configure the Backup Manager](#backup-manager)
  * [Configure BOSH Errands](#errands)
  * [Configure Resources](#resource-config)
  * [Configure Stemcells](#stemcell)

5. Click **Apply Changes** to deploy the service.

After you installing the a9s MySQL for PCF, it is available in the list of marketplace services.
For more information, see [Using a9s MySQL for PCF](./using.html).


###<a id="azs"></a>Assign AZs and Networks

Use **Assign AZs and Networks** to configure the location of service instance jobs.
You should configure your network to balance cluster jobs across as many availability zones (AZs) as possible.

###<a id='errands'></a>Configure Errands

Use **Errands** to configure the lifecycle errands that run when you install or uninstall a9s MySQL for PCF.
The list below describes each errand.
For more information, see [Understanding Lifecycle Errands](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html).

<%= image_tag("a9s-mysql-for-pcf-errands.png") %>


#### Post-Deploy Errands

 * **Run BOSH Configurator**:
  This errand configures a9s BOSH for PCF so that it can provision MySQL
  service instances. When enabled, this errand uploads the required releases in
  the a9s BOSH Director. Disabling this errand might speed up the deployment of
  all tiles.

  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To ensure your configuration remains up-to-date, disable this errand only when necessary.</p>

 * **Run Template Uploader**:
  This errand is required to configure generic components that are included in a9s MySQL for PCF with MySQL configurations.
  Disabling this errand might speed up the deployment of all tiles.

  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To ensure your configuration remains up-to-date, disable this errand only when necessary.</p>

 * **Run Broker Registrar**:
  This errand registers the a9s MySQL for PCF service broker
  with Elastic Runtime. This makes the service available in the Elastic Runtime
  marketplace.

 * **Run Smoke Tests**:
 This errand runs a series of basic tests against your a9s MySQL for PCF
 installation to ensure that it is configured properly. The tests can
 take over 30 minutes.

#### Pre-Delete Errands

 * **Delete all a9s MySQL instances**:
  This errand deletes all a9s MySQL instances that were created with `cf create-service`.
  <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: This task cannot be undone. All VMs of the service instances are permanently deleted.
    If a service instance is bound to an app or has existing service keys, the errand fails.</p>

 * **Run Broker Deregistrar**:
  This errand unregisters the a9s MySQL for PCF service broker in Elastic Runtime. It also removes the a9s MySQL service from the Elastic Runtime marketplace.

###<a id='resource-config'></a> Configure Resources

You can configure the dimensions of the VMs that host the a9s MySQL for PCF components.
This configuration does not cover the dedicated MySQL instances that run on VMs provided by the a9s BOSH tile for PCF.
For more information, see [Configure Service Plan VMs](#configure-service-instance).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Anynines recommends using a VM Type of large or greater to support the tile compilation.</p>

<%= image_tag("a9s-mysql-resource-config.png") %>


###<a id="stemcell"></a>Configure Stemcells

If you want to use a stemcell other than the default, click **Stemcell**, and then click **Import Stemcell** to upload the stemcell.

<%= image_tag("stemcell-tab.png") %>

##<a id="configure-service-instance"></a> Configure Service Plans

The sizes and types of VMs used to provision service instances of a given service plan are specified in the **Cloud Config** pane of the a9s BOSH for PCF tile. See the <em>Cloud Config</em> section of the <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/partners/a9s-bosh/installing.html">a9s BOSH for PCF installation documentation</a> that corresponds to your IaaS.</p>

The table below lists available service plans:

| This plan... | Uses these a9s BOSH for PCF settings to determine VM and disk size |
|------|-------|
|mysql-single-small| Cloud properties for the VM Type Small<br /> Cloud properties for the Disk Type Small|
|mysql-single-big| Cloud properties for the VM Type Large<br /> Cloud properties for the Disk Type Big|
|mysql-cluster-small| Cloud properties for the VM Type Small<br /> Cloud properties for the Disk Type Small|
|mysql-cluster-big| Cloud properties for the VM Type Large<br /> Cloud properties for the Disk Type Big|


##<a id='deployment_updater'></a>Update Existing Service Instances

After updating the a9s MySQL for PCF tile, run the Deployment Updater errand to update all provisioned service instances to the new service and stemcell versions.<br />

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: anynines recommends running the <a href="./installing.html#errands" target="_blank">smoke tests</a> before running this errand.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To run the errand, you must log in to the Ops Manager Director. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#prepare" target="_blank">Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI</a>.</p>

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM:
<pre class="terminal">
$ ssh ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN
Password: ***********
</pre>

2. Target the BOSH Director:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate target OPS-MANAGER-DIRECTOR-IP
Target set to DIRECTOR\_UUID
</pre>

3. Log in to the BOSH Director:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh login
Your username: director
Enter password: DIRECTOR\_CREDENTIAL
Logged in as 'director'
</pre>

4. Run `bosh deployments` and record the name of the a9s MySQL for PCF deployment from the **Name** column:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh deployments
Acting as user 'director' on 'p-bosh'
+------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------
| Name                                     | Release(s)                    | Stemcell(s)

</pre>

5. Switch the CLI to operate on the a9s MySQL for PCF deployment by running `bosh deployment /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/DEPLOYMENT-NAME.yml` with the `a9s-mysql101-service-...` name from the previous step:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh deployment /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/a9s-mysql101-service-94443f82b52dcf333bbd.yml
% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                               Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   352  100   352    0     0  12014      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 12137
Deployment set to '/var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/a9s-mysql101-service-94443f82b52dcf333bbd.yml'</pre>

6. (Optional) Run `bosh run errand mysql-smoke-­tests` to ensure that your a9s MySQL for PCF installation is configured properly.

7. Run `bosh run errand deployment-updater` to force the update for all existing a9s MySQL for PCF instances:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh run errand deployment-updater
% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                               Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   352  100   352    0     0  26378      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 27076
Acting as user 'director' on deployment 'a9s-mysql101-service-94443f82b52dcf333bbd' on 'p-bosh'
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
...
&nbsp;
Errand 'deployment-updater' completed successfully (exit code 0)
</pre>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Depending on the number of service instances,
  the Deployment Updater may take significant time to finish running. BOSH shows no
  logging output while the errand runs.</p>
